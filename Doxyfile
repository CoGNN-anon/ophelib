# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

# If this flag is set to YES, the members of anonymous namespaces will be
# extracted and appear in the documentation as a namespace called
# 'anonymous_namespace{file}', where file will be replaced with the base name of
# the file that contains the anonymous namespace. By default anonymous namespace
# are hidden.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ANON_NSPACES   = NO

# If the HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide any

# blocks will be appended to the function's detailed documentation block.
# The default value is: NO.

# If the SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES tag is set to YES then doxygen will put a list of
# the files that are included by a file in the documentation of that file.

SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES     = YES

# If the SHOW_GROUPED_MEMB_INC tag is set to YES then Doxygen will add for each
# grouped member an include statement to the documentation, telling the reader
# which file to include in order to use the member.
# The default value is: NO.

# If the FORCE_LOCAL_INCLUDES tag is set to YES then doxygen will list include

# If the INLINE_INFO tag is set to YES then a tag [inline] is inserted in the
# documentation for inline members.

# If the SORT_MEMBER_DOCS tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the

# type resolution of all parameters of a function it will reject a match between
# the prototype and the implementation of a member function even if there is
# only one candidate or it is obvious which candidate to choose by doing a
# simple string match. By disabling STRICT_PROTO_MATCHING doxygen will still
# accept a match between prototype and implementation in such cases.

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain

# spaces.
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# If the value of the EXAMPLE_PATH tag contains directories, you can use the
# EXAMPLE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left blank all
# files are included.

EXAMPLE_PATTERNS       =

# If the EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE tag is set to YES then subdirectories will be

# The default value is: NO.

EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE      = NO

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that
# is part of the input, its contents will be placed on the main page

# and want to reuse the introduction page also for the doxygen output.
