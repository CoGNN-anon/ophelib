     * Reduction of modulo `p^2*q^2` in the first step is easy to do â€“ simply
     * compute everything modulo `p^2` and `q^2` in parallel then use the Chinese
     * Remainder Theorem (CRT) to combine the result. However, we found it
     * much faster to further split `p^2` (and `q^2`) as well and represent a
     * value A as `a0+a1*p modulo p^2`. Then, computing `A*B` mod `p^2` is better
     * (faster) done with such a representation, where you convert A into a
     * base p number => E.g.
     *   `A * B = a0 * b0 + p * (a0 * b1 + a1 * b0) + p^2 * (a1 * b1) mod p^2
     *   = a0 * b0 + p * (a0 * b1 + a1 * b0)`, not to forget the carry bit.
     * This is much faster than plain mod p^2 computation.
     *
     * IF YOU PLAN ON MODIFYING THIS CODE TO MAKE IT FASTER, FIRST TAKE
     * A LOOK AT THE CODE DELETED IN COMMIT 1e70dd1.
